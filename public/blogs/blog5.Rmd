# About me

Nice to meet you! I'm Hui Sheng from *Suzhou, China*. Currently I'm a master in financial analysis student in **London Business School**. This is my portfolio website. Feel free to contact me!


# My hobbies

1. **Piano**. I have been playing the piano for more than 15 years and music has become an indispensable part of my life. Chopin is my favorite, whose nocturnes, ballads and etudes deeply impress me.

2. **Traveling**. I spent a lot of time traveling with friends and family. Last summer my parents and I drove our own car from Suzhou to Xinjiang and played around for a month. It was a 10-thousand-kilometer tour and my driving skill improved a lot!

3. **Sports**. Tell me if you also like playing badminton, table-tennis or going climbing!


> Here's my favorite nocturne performed by one of my favorite pianists.
[Chopin - Nocturne op.9 No.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUN5ioqlh5U)
