Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data.


```{r warning=FALSE, load_data, cache=TRUE}
# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom(url)%>%
  clean_names()

```


Based on the data, we could produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.


Before we start the analysis we have to get rid of data entries that donâ€™t give us any information.



```{r, clean_data, warning=FALSE}

# Cleaning the data set by replacing "Unknown" and "Missing" values with "NA"

covid_data <- covid_data %>% 
  mutate(icu_yn = case_when(
    icu_yn == "Unknown" ~ NA_character_,
    icu_yn == "Missing" ~ NA_character_,
    TRUE ~ icu_yn
    ), death_yn = case_when(
    death_yn == "Unknown" ~ NA_character_,
    death_yn == "Missing" ~ NA_character_,
    TRUE ~ death_yn
    ), medcond_yn = case_when(
    medcond_yn == "Unknown" ~ NA_character_,
    medcond_yn == "Missing" ~ NA_character_,
    TRUE ~ medcond_yn
    ), sex = case_when(
    sex == "Unknown" ~ NA_character_,
    sex == "Missing" ~ NA_character_,
    sex == "Other" ~ NA_character_,
    TRUE ~ sex
    ), age_group = case_when(
    age_group == "Unknown" ~ NA_character_,
    age_group == "Missing" ~ NA_character_,
    TRUE ~ age_group))

```

After arranging, we can plot our data to make better inferences:

```{r, plot_for_medcond, warning=FALSE}

# we group the data by icu_yn to determine the effects of COVID across different groups of people

covid_data_grouped_by_medcond <- covid_data %>%
  group_by(age_group, sex, medcond_yn) %>% 
  filter(death_yn != is.na(death_yn) & sex != is.na(sex) & medcond_yn != is.na(medcond_yn) & age_group != is.na(age_group)) %>% 
  summarise(death_rate = count(death_yn=="Yes") / (count(death_yn=="Yes") + count(death_yn=="No"))) 


# To make our data easier to understand we change the entries in medcond_yn

covid_data_grouped_by_medcond$medcond_yn <- factor(covid_data_grouped_by_medcond$medcond_yn, levels = c("Yes", "No"), 
                  labels = c("With comorbidities", "Without comorbidities"))


plot_medcond<- ggplot(covid_data_grouped_by_medcond, aes(x=death_rate, y=age_group)) + 
  geom_col(aes(show.legend = FALSE), fill="cornflowerblue", alpha=0.7) + 
  facet_grid(medcond_yn ~ sex) +
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Covid death % by age group, sex and presence of co-morbidities") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(death_rate * 100,1), hjust = 0.1),
            size=2) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) + 
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labs(caption = "Source: CDC")+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5))+
  coord_fixed(ratio = 0.04)
  
plot_medcond

```

It can be seen that there is a clear correlation between age and mortality rate. The same holds true for earlier diagnosis of co-morbidities and mortality rate. Another interesting inference is that there is a higher probability of men dying from COVID than of women.

In our second plot we look at correlation of covid deaths and admittance to the intensive care unit:

```{r, plot_for_icu, warning=FALSE}

# we group the data by icu_yn to determine the effects of COVID across different groups of people

covid_data_grouped_by_icu <- covid_data %>%   
  group_by(age_group, sex, icu_yn) %>% 
  filter(death_yn != is.na(death_yn) & sex != is.na(sex) & icu_yn != is.na(icu_yn) & age_group != is.na(age_group)) %>% 
  summarise(death_rate = count(death_yn=="Yes") / (count(death_yn=="Yes") + count(death_yn=="No")))


# To make our data easier to understand we change the entries in icu_yn

covid_data_grouped_by_icu$icu_yn <- factor(covid_data_grouped_by_icu$icu_yn, levels = c("Yes", "No"), 
                  labels = c("Admitted to ICU", "No ICU"))


plot_icu <- ggplot(covid_data_grouped_by_icu, aes(x=death_rate, y=age_group)) + 
  geom_col(aes(show.legend = FALSE), fill="coral1", alpha = 0.7) + 
  facet_grid(icu_yn ~ sex) +
  #facet_wrap(~sex + icu_yn, scale="free") + 
  theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Covid death % by age group, sex and whether patient was admitted to ICU") +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(death_rate * 100,1), hjust = 0.1),
            size=2) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank()) + theme(axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labs(caption = "Source: CDC")+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5))+
  coord_fixed(ratio = 0.04)

plot_icu


```

Here it can be clearly seen that on average a much higher percentage of people who were admitted to the ICU died. Again we can also see that men and older people are more likely to die.
